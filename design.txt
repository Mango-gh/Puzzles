Compatibility Score:
- Explicit vector(Similarity Matrix) and Implicit vector(Latent Embedding) [Big 5, attachment style, humour]
- Compatibility is not “just similarity” — some dimensions want similarity, others want complementarity.
- Show user why compatibility score is what it is.

-Trait Extraction
	
Explicit: 
	Straight Forward
	
Implicit: 
	1.From Profile Prompts
	2.Psychometrics Questionnaire
	3.From Interaction Behavior on the App
	3.Micro-Surveys or Gamified Quizzes
	Issue: Consumes user time.

MVP GOAL:
	-RAG is able to extract implicit traits and score them using(JSON traits)
	-Compute a compatibility score based on rule-based weighted similarity (later we can change to a learning ranked model)

Question:
How do we address the ratio problem and the user involvement problem, we have to extract implicit user traits without it being tedious
